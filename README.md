# ChaoCipher Cryptography
## Shifaul Emdad
## Overview
The ChaoCipher is a classical cipher system invented by John F. Byrne in 1918. This project implements an encryption and decryption system based on the ChaoCipher in Processing, allowing users to visualize the encryption and decryption process. Chaocipher encryption uses two rotating disks on which is written a custom alphabet (originally the 26 letters from A to Z using a deranged alphabet). The two disks are identical and linked with a kind of gearing (ratio 1:1), if a disk is turned clockwise, the other turns anti-clockwise.
## Instructions
### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Processing installed on your computer. You can download it from [Processing.org](https://processing.org/download).

#### Compilation Steps
1. Download and Install Processing: Ensure you have Processing installed on your system.
2. Clone the Project Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open the Project in Processing:
   - Open Processing.
   - Go to File -> Open... and navigate to the project directory.
   - Open the main project folder. Processing will load all .pde files as tabs.
4. Run the Project:
   - Click the "Run" button in Processing to start the visualization.

### Using the Project

#### Encryption:
   - The project starts with the encryption mode.
   - The original plaintext is displayed at the top.
   - Click anywhere on the canvas to proceed through the encryption process step-by-step.
   - The current state of the ciphertext and the encryption process will be displayed.
   - Once the encryption is complete, the final ciphertext is displayed.

#### Decryption:
   - The decryption process can be visualized in a similar manner (code not included in this example but structured similarly).

### PRESENTATION:
   - Slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HjtvPFUgqRVzYVRb_r5nBy1mQj2IaXnV8uk2mD7ljD8/edit?usp=sharing
   - Contains a detailed presentation of the project, including explanations and visuals.
