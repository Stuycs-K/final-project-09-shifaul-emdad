### 2024-05-19 to 2024-05-27

May 19-27: Unfortunately, during this period, I was dealing with a stubborn flu that kept me bedridden. I tried to keep up with the project remotely, but my energy levels were low, and I couldn't concentrate much. My main focus during this time was on resting and recuperating.

### 2024-05-28

May 28: Feeling better today, I decided to explore the fascinating world of cryptography. After some research, I stumbled upon the ChaoCipher, an intriguing classical cipher system. Excited by its history and complexity, I made the decision to base my project on it.

### 2024-05-29

May 29: Today, I delved deep into understanding the intricacies of the ChaoCipher on [dcode.fr/chao-cipher](https://www.dcode.fr/chao-cipher). I spent hours studying its algorithm, deciphering techniques, and historical context. I also began brainstorming ideas for implementing the encryption and decryption processes in Processing.

### 2024-05-30

May 30: With a solid understanding of the ChaoCipher, I started working on implementing the encryption algorithm. However, I encountered some challenges along the way, particularly with the permutation logic. Despite several attempts, I couldn't get the encryption process to work as intended.

### 2024-05-31

May 31: After some intense debugging and problem-solving, I finally made progress with the encryption algorithm. I managed to resolve the issues with the permutation logic and successfully implemented the encryption process. It was a satisfying breakthrough after hours of persistence.

### 2024-06-03

June 3: Today, I focused on testing the encryption functionality thoroughly to ensure its accuracy and reliability. I simulated various scenarios and input data to validate the encryption process's effectiveness. It was crucial to ensure that the encrypted output remained consistent and secure.

### 2024-06-07

June 7: With the encryption process working smoothly, I turned my attention to creating a captivating presentation for the project. I spent the day crafting slides, refining content, and practicing my delivery. It was essential to effectively communicate the ChaoCipher's intricacies and the project's implementation details.
